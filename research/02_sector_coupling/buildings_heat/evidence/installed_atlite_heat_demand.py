def heat_demand(cutout, threshold=15.0, a=1.0, constant=0.0, hour_shift=0.0, **params):
    """
    Convert outside temperature into daily heat demand using the degree-day
    approximation.

    Since "daily average temperature" means different things in
    different time zones and since xarray coordinates do not handle
    time zones gracefully like pd.DateTimeIndex, you can provide an
    hour_shift to redefine when the day starts.

    E.g. for Moscow in winter, hour_shift = 4, for New York in winter,
    hour_shift = -5

    This time shift applies across the entire spatial scope of ds for
    all times. More fine-grained control will be built in a some
    point, i.e. space- and time-dependent time zones.

    WARNING: Because the original data is provided every month, at the
    month boundaries there is untidiness if you use a time shift. The
    resulting xarray will have duplicates in the index for the parts
    of the day in each month at the boundary. You will have to
    re-average these based on the number of hours in each month for
    the duplicated day.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float
        Outside temperature in degrees Celsius above which there is no
        heat demand.
    a : float
        Linear factor relating heat demand to outside temperature.
    constant : float
        Constant part of heat demand that does not depend on outside
        temperature (e.g. due to water heating).
    hour_shift : float
        Time shift relative to UTC for taking daily average

    Note
    ----
    You can also specify all of the general conversion arguments
    documented in the `convert_and_aggregate` function.
